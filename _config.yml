user_description: "Currently Technical Leader at Decathlon and graduated of MIAGE Master's degree, I am thirsty for learning and sharing!
Indeed, passionate about IT, I like to keep abreast of new developments in the field, whether technical (languages, methods and work environment) or leisure (innovation, general public, hi-tech).
Young, dynamic and voluntary, I love to live my passion by participating in innovative projects while sharing my knowledge."
